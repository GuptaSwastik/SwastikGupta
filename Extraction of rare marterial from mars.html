<h1 style="font-size:50px;text-align:center;"> Extraction rare material from mars  </h1>

<p style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;margin-bottom: 50px;">Extracting rare materials from Mars is being explored through various methods, including biomining, In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), and sample return missions. Biomining uses microorganisms to leach valuable metals from Martian regolith, potentially for in-situ use. ISRU aims to utilize Martian resources for construction and other purposes, with iron extraction from regolith being a key focus. Sample return missions, like the one led by NASA and ESA, aim to bring samples back to Earth for detailed analysis and scientific discovery</p>
